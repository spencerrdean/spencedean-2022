As a technical writer, I combine technical knowledge and communication skills to craft simple documentation out of complex information. I currently work at Salesforce and write UX text, help content, and developer docs that teach users to build digital storefronts with Salesforce Commerce. I enjoy collaborating cross-functionally with product managers, software engineers, and UX designers to understand products and influence design decisions as an advocate for excellent content experiences, and especially love tackling tricky content strategy and information architecture questions.

Previously, I was a computational research assistant at the [Wesleyan Media Project](https://mediaproject.wesleyan.edu/) while receiving my B.A. in Psychology and Data Science at Wesleyan University. In my work for the Media Project, I applied data science and statistical analysis methodologies to answer questions about political advertising on digital platforms like Facebook and Snapchat.

I'm based in San Francisco and fill my free time with running, skateboarding, and playing guitar.
